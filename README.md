# ARINDAE: Active Recall Inspired Neural Deterministic Autoencoder

This repository contains the implementation of **ARINDAE**, a novel neural network architecture for image reconstruction, along with baseline Autoencoder (AE) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The models are trained and evaluated on the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset.

---

## Features

- **Hybrid Encoder** combining VGG-like and ResNet-like convolutional blocks.
- **ARINDAE Model**:
  - Active Recall-inspired recurrent reconstruction.
  - Supports stochastic latent representations using VAE-style reparameterization.
  - Input masking for improved robustness.
- Evaluation using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**
  - **Inception Score (IS)**
- Visual comparison of reconstructions and uncertainty visualization.

pip install torch torchvision tqdm==4.64.1 matplotlib numpy scikit-learn scipy pandas

This is ready to upload as `README.md` and will give your GitHub repo a professional look with all instructions, results, and visualization sections.  

If you want, I can **also write a small script to automatically save the reconstruction images** so you can link them in this README for visual effect. Do you want me to do that?
